Finite Element Library Implemented in Go
This library is designed for the application of the finite element method in structural engineering problems. It's a work in progress, intended to offer robust tools for analyzing structural behavior.
The software is work in progress.

Usage from the command line:

go run main.go examples/D1/example1.json

In this command the  parameter is the path to the JSON file describing the problem to be solved.

The code is tested with examples provided by "A first course in the finite element method" written by Daryl L.Logan - VI ed.
